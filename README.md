# Project Description:

I will be creating an app that allows high end body piercers to build custom jewelry for their clients. This app will create 3d model of current offerings and allow jewelers to add different gem/colors/cuts to the setting and be able to visualize how it will go together. 

## Problem Statement:

Currently there is now way to see how the cuts and colors will look in different settings. The current market for high end jewelry is expanding as the body modification industry continues to expand. The client base would be piercers that have accounts with the select high end jewelry companies. 

## Fixing the problem

My app will show customers how a piece of jewelry will look with the selected design of gems/colors/cuts, by rendering a 3d model of the jewelry with the selected design.


## User Experience

User will sign in with chosen credentials.

User will be able to search inventory based on many options (company, size, location, jem choice, cutâ€¦.)

User will be able to choose the jewelry and drag and drop selected gems into the grid of possible options. This will render the design as a 3d model. 

Once a design is chosen the user will be able to place the order with the company. This will require a user to sign in to there account with the company. 

## Tech

Blender, A-frame, React/Native?, Java or Python?, Some style(gotta talk to Alyssa). Not sure if there is an API from each design company but i am trying to get in touch with them
